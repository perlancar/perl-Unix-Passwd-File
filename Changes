Revision history for Perl extension Unix-Passwd-File

0.01     2012-08-30 (SHARYANTO) (not yet released)

         First release. I created a new module instead of using
         Passwd::Unix::Alt mainly because of these reasons: 1) got tired of
         having to input passwd, shadow, group, gshadow separately; with
         Unix::Passwd::File I just need to specify etc_dir; 2) I didn't get
         locking to work, something which I think is important and I'd rather
         start with a clean codebase to make sure this and other things work; 3)
         want a cleaner interface, without any global error variable.
